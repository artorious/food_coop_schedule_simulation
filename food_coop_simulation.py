""" A Food Co-op's Worker Scheduling Simulation

Schedule requires two members working (on-the-clock) at all times.
Program  simulates the number of people that show up for work using two 
different worker scheduling methods in which;
    - Workers sign up for certain time slots
    - Workers show up whenever they want.

The program  performs simulation for both scheduled and unscheduled approaches
based on assumed probabilities of typical human behaviour.

Compares the effectivenes of the scheduled vs. the unscheduled approach both 
from the co-op's and the members' point of view.
