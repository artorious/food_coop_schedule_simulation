# food_coop_simulation.py - A Food Co-op's Worker Scheduling Simulation

A food co-op needs two members working (on-the-clock) at all times.
Program  simulates the <mark>number of people that show up for work</mark> 
at a food co-op using two different worker scheduling methods in which;
    - Workers <mark>sign up</mark> for certain time slots
    - Workers <mark>show up whenever</mark> they want.

The Problem
===========
The program should be capable of performing simulation for both scheduled and 
unscheduled approaches based on assumed probabilities of typical human
behaviour.

Compare the effectivenes of the scheduled vs. the unscheduled approach both 
from the co-op's and the members' point of view.
 

Usage
=====
Run:
<pre>
$ <kbd>python3 food_coop_simulation.py</kbd>
</pre>
